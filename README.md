👋 Hi, I’m @jokerlufei

👀 I’m interested in data analysis, statistical modeling, and solving complex problems using R programming.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in R, such as data visualization with ggplot2, machine learning integration, and performance optimization.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving R programming, especially those where error handling and debugging are critical.

📫 How to reach me: Feel free to reach out via GitHub issues or email for any R-related bugs, errors, or consulting requests!

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy the challenge of debugging R scripts and helping others optimize their code for better performance and efficiency!
